# Zigbee Bridge - Developer Edition

**Looking for Feedback**

I have some spare Zigbee radios in stock and wanted to get an idea of what users would like to have included in a Zigbee Bridge/Coordinator.

Bearing in mind, I would like to keep the cost low, and make it fairly "universal".

This is what I have so far...

### On Board
- USB Interface 
  - USB Micro (not USB C due to cost and enclosure cutouts)
  - CH340E USB Driver - low cost
<br>
- 3V3 1A Power Supply
  - Optional 5V Input via DC 2.5mm Jack
<br>
- Zigbee Radio Module based on EFR32MG21A020F1024
  - Mini Simplicity and SWD programming interfaces
<br>
- Indicator LED
- User button (Commissioning and Bootload)
<br>
- Wall mountable enclosure

### Optional Extras (plugin sockets)
